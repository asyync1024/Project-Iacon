# Overview

**Project-Iacon** is a repository of scripts designed to assist users setup their system post-manual installation from the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page), with many useful features.

# The name
Let's talk about the name, I had chose this name because at the time of starting this project, I was watching Transformers Prime, in which Megatron wanted
Orion Pax to complete certain decoding tasks. You can search it up if you want.

- **Various optimizations from the Arch Wiki**  
  Applies several performance,latency and other optimizations from the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page)

  **WARNING:** The fast_commit option for `ext4` can be dangerous and cause corruption and require an `fsck` in case of a powercut. See: [Arch Wiki: Ext4#Enabling_fast_commit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Ext4#Enabling_fast_commit)
- **DE Installation**  
  Installs a DE of choice, with various options like KDE (Minimal, Meta, Full), Gnome, XFCE and i3 (Creator's configuration!)

  [aurutils](https://github.com/aurutils/aurutils/), an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers), is also installed and setup accordingly (Required for installing legacy dkms Nvidia drivers)

- **Root-privilege User Creation**  
  Creates a new root-privilege-user instead of using `root` for the Master script

## Requirements
